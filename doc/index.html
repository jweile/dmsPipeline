	<h1>POPCode Pipeline</h1>
	<p>Jochen Weile, Roth Lab 2016</p>
	<h2>Installation and prerequisites</h2>
	<p>Installation requires <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">Mercurial</a> and <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R v3.0 or higher</a>. To clone the code repository execute:
	<code><pre>hg clone http://dalai.mshri.on.ca/~jweile/projects/popcodePipeline/</pre></code>
	</p>
	<h2>Usage</h2>
	<p>
		Navigate to the resulting folder. You will find a makefile with the following targets, corresponding to the different steps in the pipeline:
	</p>
	<table>
		<tr><th>Target</th><th>Description</th></tr>
		<tr><td><code>barseqTS</code></td><td>Analyze the BarSEQ time series data from raw barcode counts</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>tileseq</code></td><td>Analyze the TileSEQ complementation data from raw mutation counts</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>scaleAndJoin</code></td><td>Re-scale the TileSEQ data to match the BarSEQ scale and join the datasets</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>impute</code></td><td>Build a feature table and then use RandomForest prediction to impute missing data and regularize poorly measured data points</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>geneticInteractions</code></td><td>Use double-mutant information to detect intragenic epistasis</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>compensatory</code></td><td>Use intragenic epistasis and C_alpha distances to find candidate compensatory relationships</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>pickSpottingClones</code></td><td>Pick a set of clones to be tested in a manual spotting assay</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>evaluateSpotting</code></td><td>Compare the results of the manual spotting assay to the results of the previous pipeline steps (barseq, tileseq, impute, etc)</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>accCons</code></td><td>Plot the relationship between mutant fitness and surface accessibility, interfacialness and conservation</td></tr>
	</table>
	<p>
		You can either execute all of them by simply running:
		<code><pre>make</pre></code>
		Or alternatively, you can execute individual goals and their respective prerequisites using e.g.:
		<code><pre>make geneticInteractions finalize</pre></code>
		Note, that you should always append the finalize goal when addressing individual goals, as this is required to produce a valid output HTML file.
	</p>
	<p>The goals are interdependent with each other. This means that when you execute a higher-ranking goal, its prerequisites will also be executed beforehand. For example, the imputation analysis is dependent on the results of the scaleAndJoin analysis, which in turn depends on the results of the barseq and tileseq analyses. Thus, when you call on the pipeline to perform the imputation, it will first execute the barseq, tileseq and scaleAndJoin goals before finally executing the desired imputation goal. The interdependence of all of the goals in the pipeline is shown in the figure below.</p>

	<h2>Output</h2>
	<p>The output of the pipeline will appear in the folder called "workspace", in which a new subfolder named according to the current date and time will be placed. Within these folders you will find all figures, tables and data files generated by your pipeline execution. In addition, the folder contains a HTML file called <code>results.html</code>, which shows all the figures generated during the run and links to the PDF versions of these images.</p>
